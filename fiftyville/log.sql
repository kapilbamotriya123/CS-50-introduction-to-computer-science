--1. Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the
--   bakery parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery
--   parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

--2. earlier this morning theif was withdrawing some money from atm on Leggett Sreet

--3. As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
--   I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then
--   asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket
